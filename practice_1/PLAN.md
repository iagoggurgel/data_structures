# WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF ALGORITHMS

The algorithms I want to use are:

## Stable:

1. Distribution Sort
2. Insertion Sort OK
3. Merge Sort 
4. Selection Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Unstable:

1. Heap Sort

It's important to make sure to explain what we mean with Stable and Unstable.

# MEASUREMENTS FRAMEWORK

The idea here is pretty simple. Make 200 input files to be served into the algorithms and user logger functions to take
the measurements. After that, with those informations the idea is to plot the discretized graph using the number of inputs
and It's runtime and compare with the continuous runtime function that has been calculated towards the algorithm runtime.
