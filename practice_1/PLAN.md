# WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF ALGORITHMS

The algorithms I want to use are:

## Stable:

1. Distribution Sort To-do
2. Insertion Sort OK
3. Merge Sort To-do
4. Selection Sort To-do
5. Quick Sort To-do
6. Counting Sort

## Unstable:

1. Heap Sort

It's important to make sure to explain what we mean with Stable and Unstable.

## Unrelated Algorithms

1. Quine-McCluskey

# MEASUREMENTS FRAMEWORK

Measure time and separate in a "<algorithm>.csv" with two columns: number of inputs and runtime.

## Code listings

1. All algorithms
2. All utility code
3. Input Builder code
